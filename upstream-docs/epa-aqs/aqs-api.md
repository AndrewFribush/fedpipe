# Air Quality System (AQS) API

Welcome to the AQS API (version 2).

This API is the primary place to obtain row-level data from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) database. If you would
like aggregated or visual data from AQS, or large files of pre-extracted data,
AirData
is the place to start.

AQS contains ambient air sample data collected by state, local, tribal, and federal air pollution control
agencies from thousands of monitors around the nation. It also contains meteorological data, descriptive
information about each monitoring station (including its geographic location and its operator), and
information about the quality of the samples.
More about AQS.
Note, AQS does not contain real-time air quality data (it can take 6 months or more from
the time data is collected until it is in AQS). For real-time data, please visit the
AirNow API

Data from this API is available to anyone but is targeted at application developers and data analysts who
are familiar with the data and its interpretation. You must sign up to obtain a key to use the API.

The remainder of this page contains a description of the services, how to construct them, and examples.
We also have OpenAPI specifications (json)
available.

Please email us with any suggested changes to the API or documentation.

### Services Overview

This table lists the services available and the type of data each one provides.
Each is linked to detailed construction rules and examples.

Service
Description

Sign up
Creates an account or resets a password. Requires validation of registered email address. Email will
be sent to the registered address from aqsdatamart@epa.gov. This service can also be
used to reset passwords.

Meta Data
Returns information about the API. Is it available/up? What are the meanings of the fields in my returned data?
Recent and planned changes, etc.

List
Provides information you need to construct other queries. Valid values for the required
variables: parameter code, state code, etc. (See below.)

Monitors
Returns operational information about the samplers (monitors) used to collect the data. Includes identifying information,
operational dates, operating organizations, etc.

Sample Data
Returns sample data - the finest grain data reported to EPA. Usually hourly, sometimes 5-minute, 12-hour, etc.
This service is available in several geographic selections based on geography: site, county, state,
CBSA (core based statistical area, a grouping of counties), or latitude/longitude bounding box.

Daily Summary
Returns data summarized at the daily level. All daily summaries are calculated on midnight to midnight basis in
local time. Variables returned include date, mean value, maximum value, etc.

Quarterly Summary
Returns data summarized at the calendar quarter level (Q1 = Jan - Mar, Q2 = Apr - Jun, Q3 = Jul - Sep, Q4 = Oct - Dec).
Variables include mean value, maxima, percentiles, etc.

Annual Summary
Returns data summarized at the yearly level. Variables include mean value, maxima, percentiles, etc.

QA Annual Performance Evaluations
Quality assurance data - annual performance evaluations. A performance evaluation must be conducted on each
primary monitor once a year. The percent differences between known and measured concentrations at several levels
are used to assess the quality of the monitoring data.

QA Blanks
Quality assurance data - blanks samples. Blanks are unexposed sample collection devices (e.g., filters) that
are transported with the exposed sample devices to assess if contamination is occurring during the transport
or handling of the samples.

QA Collocated Assessments
Quality assurance data - collocated assessments. Collocated assessments are pairs of samples collected by
different samplers at the same time and place. (These are "operational" samplers, assessments with independently
calibrated samplers are called "audits".)

QA Flow Rate Verifications
Quality assurance data - flow rate verifications. Several times per year, each PM monitor must have it's (fixed)
flow rate verified by an operator taking a measurement of the flow rate.

QA Flow Rate Audits
Quality assurance data - flow rate audits. At least twice year, each PM monitor must have its flow
rate measurement audited by an expert using a different method than is used for flow rate verifications.

QA One Point QC Raw Data
Quality assurance data - one point quality control check raw data. At least every two weeks, certain gaseous
monitors must be challenged with a known concentration to determine monitor performance.

QA PEP Audits
Quality assurance data - performance evaluation program (PEP) audits. PEP audits are independent
assessments used to estimate total measurement system bias with a primary quality assurance organization.

Transaction - Sample
AQS Submission Transaction Format for Sample Data - sample (raw) data in the AQS submission
transaction format (RD). Includes data both in submitted and standard units.

Transaction - QA Annual Performance Evaluations
AQS Submission Transaction Format for Annual Performance Evaluation data. Includes data pairs for QA.

### Variables used in service requests

These are the variables you will use to construct your request. See the details below about which variables are
required and which are optional for each request type. If a variable contains text, that text is case sensitive.
For example, if using the parameter class for CRITERIA pollutants, it must be in all upper case.

Variable
Description
Example

email
The email address of the requester.
someone@provider.com

key
The key matching the email address for the requester. This is provided at registration. (This is not referred
to as a password since it is not used for authentication, but only account monitoring.)
notarealkey

bdate
The begin date of the data selection in YYYYMMDD format. Only data on or after this date will be returned. (Note, for annual data, only the year portion of the bdate and edate are used and only whole years of data are returned. For example, bdate = 20171231 and edate = 20180101 will return full data for 2017 and 2018.)
20170101

edate
The end date of the data selection in YYYYMMDD format. Only data on or before this date will be returned. The end date must be in the same year as the begin date. This rule does not apply to the Monitors service. (Note, for annual data, only the year portion of the bdate and edate are used and only whole years of data are returned. For example, bdate = 20170531 and edate = 20170630 will return full data for 2017.)
20171231

param
The AQS parameter code for the data selection. AQS uses proprietary 5 digit codes. They may be obtained via the
list parameters service. Up to 5 parameters may be requested, separated by commas. Only data for these parameters will be returned.

durations do not apply - you cannot get 8-hour ozone this way, for example.) A list of valid duration codes
may be viewed on this page,
and the "Observed" durations are valid entries. Not all parameters are measured
at all durations. Only data reported at this sample duration will be returned.

### Output Format - JSON

The only output format available from the services is JSON. This is in conformity with the

18f API standards for government.

The JSON response has two top-level elements. A header and a body. The header contains information about the request and the body contains
the data.
The header contains the following elements:

- status. "SUCCESS" if the request returned data. "FAILED" if the request could not be processed. "No data matched your selection" if
the request was processed but resulted in no data.

- request_time. The date and time (at the location of the server) when the request was received.

- url. The original URL that was submitted to make the request.

- row. The number of rows of data in the body object.

- errors. Any errors encountered when attempting to respond to the request.

The body is an array with one object per data row. The contents of the object will vary based on the request made. (E.g. the columns
of data returned are different for each query.

Here is a sample of the output of a Raw Data request with one data point:

{
"Header": [
{
"status": "success",
"request_time": "2018-06-13T07:45:01-04:00",
"url": "https://...",
"rows": 1
}
],
"Body": [
{
"state_code": "01",
"county_code": "073",
"site_number": "0023",
"parameter_code": "88101",
"poc": 1.0,
"latitude": 33.0,
"longitude": -86.0,
"datum": "WGS84",
"parameter_name": "PM2.5 - Local Conditions",
"date_local": "2017-04-01",
"time_local": "00:00",
"date_gmt": "2017-04-01",
"time_gmt": "06:00",
"sample_measurement": 6.2,
"unit_of_measure": "Micrograms/cubic meter (LC)",
"detection_limit": 2.0,

"state_name": "Alabama",
"county_name": "Jefferson",
"date_of_last_change": "2017-05-30",
"cbsa_code": "13820"
}
]
}

### Loading JSON into Excel

If you want to import this data into Excel, follow these steps (these may vary depending on your software version):

- Save the output of your query as a .json file

- Open Excel (the imported data will be added as a new sheet to a new or existing workbook)

- Go to the "Data" tab

- Select Get Data > From File > From JSON from the ribbon (you may have to go to Data > New Query > From File > From JSON depending on your Excel configuration)

- Find the file and open it - this should take you to the "Power Query Editor" and the "Convert" pane

- Select "Into Table" from the ribbon - this should display two columns called "Name" and "Value"

- Click on the grey box next to the word "Value" (the box contains a left-pointing arrow and a right-pointing arrow)

- Select "Expand to new rows" - this may add rows to your display

- Again, click on the grey box next to the word "Value" (the box contains a left-pointing arrow and a right-pointing arrow)

- Uncheck any columns you do not want (e.g., those from the header: status, request_time, url, and rows)

- (Optional) Uncheck the box at the bottom: "Use original column names as prefix"

- Click "OK" to close the dialogue box

- Note, you can now remove columns and sort data in this view.

- Click "Close & Load" from the close pane (top left)

- Wait a few moments and the data will appear, one row for the header and one for each record of data

The data is loaded as a table in a new sheet in the workbook. This makes some Excel functions
"grey out" (e.g., sort) when the entire sheet is selected. To sort, for example, select a cell in
table header (rather than the entire workbook or workbook header) and the sort functionality should work.

You can query the API from within Excel. At the "Data" tab, select Get Data > From Other Sources > From Web.
Enter the API request URL in the form and select "OK".
Excel should run the query and take you to the "Power Query Editor". Use the steps outlined above to
load the data into a sheet.

### Error Handling and Status Codes

If the API is able to parse your request it will return the JSON described above and an HTTP status of 200.

If the API is not able to parse your request it will return a status code of 400 and only the header, which will include an
array of error messages instead of a row count. For example:

{
"Header": [
{
"status": "Failed",
"request_time": "2018-06-13T08:05:46.588-04:00",
"url": "https://...",
"error": [
"value is missing or the value is empty: param"
]
}
],
"Body": []
}

If the API is able to parse your request but no data matches your selections, it will return the JSON header and
an HTTP status of 200. The row count will be zero, the status will be a message that no data matched your selection criteria, and the body will be empty.

{
"Header": [
{
"status": "No data matched your selection",
"request_time": "2018-06-13T10:15:42-04:00",
"url": "https://...",
"rows": 0
}
],
"Body": []
}

### Request Limits and Terms of Service

The API has the following limits imposed on request size:

- Length of time. All services (except Monitor) must have the end date (edate field) be in the
same year as the begin date (bdate field).

- Number of parameters. Most services allow for the selection of multiple parameter codes (param field). A maximum of 5 parameter codes may be listed in a single request.

Please adhere to the following when using the API.

- Limit the size of queries. Our database contains billions of values and you may request more than you intend.
If you are unsure of the amount of data, start small and work your way up.
We request that you limit queries to 1,000,000 rows of data each.
You can use the "observation count" field on the annualData service to determine how much data exists for a time-parameter-geography combination.
If you have any questions or need advice, please contact us.

- Limit the frequency of queries. Our system can process a limited load.
If scripting requests, please wait for one request to complete before submitting another and do not make more than 10 requests per minute.
Also, we request a pause of 5 seconds between requests and adjust accordingly for response time and size.

If you violate these terms, we may disable your account without notice (but we will be in contact via the email address provided).

### Usage tips

This section contains suggestions for completing certain data related tasks and links to software tools using the API.

- Determine if or how much data exists for a time-parameter-geography combination:

- Retrieve data using the annualData service.

- If no records are returned, we do not have the data.

- If records are returned, use the observation count to determine the temporal and geographic distribution of the data.

- Monthly averages:

- AQS does not routinely calculate monthly aggregate statistics.

- If you need these, you must calculate them yourself.

- These can be calculated from the sample data or the daily data without loss of fidelity.

- Determine a single value for a site with collocated monitors:

- Many sites will have collocated monitors - monitors collecting the same parameter at the same time.

- The API currently provides only monitor level values. (We anticipate adding site-level values at some point.)

- For some criteria pollutants (PM2.5, ozone, lead, and NO2), the regulations define procedures for defining a single site-level value.

- For other pollutants, determining a single site-level value is left to the investigator.

### Software Tools

The EPA has released an R package that uses this API To query AQS data. It is
available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
This software is open source and the repository page is linked to from that site. Also, please use the link there to report issues or ask
questions about the package.

### What has changed from the API version 1

The following changes have been made to the web services.

- All output is JSON. In conformity with

federal API standards, all output is now JSON

- Services have been added. Instead of one primary service, raw data, there now a multitude of services.

- The request structure has been simplified. Rather than having a mixture of required and optional variables, each service has required
variables and some have the optional change begin and end dates.

- There is no interface to help users build a query. Previously, an interface was provided with drop downs to assist users in building a query.
In retrospect, this led to as many questions as is solved, so we are no longer providing it.

- Asynchronous requests have been removed. All requests now return data.

- Uptime should be better. The number of moving parts behind the scenes has been reduced and we expect less downtime.

- Terms have changed. "User ID" and "password" have been changed to "email" and "key" to better reflect meaning. Old accounts are still valid.

- Query size limits have been removed. You may query as much data as you like. If this does not work, we will put limits on accounts.

- The URL has changed from aqs.epa.gov/api to aqs.epa.gov/data/api. This is to allow for both to run concurrently during
the transition period and to make room for other potential (non-data) APIs.

- The sample data service returns null samples.
