# QuickStats API

Introduction

Terms of Service

Usage

Request API Key

The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) offers Quick Stats, an on-line database containing official published aggregate estimates related to U.S. agricultural production. NASS develops these estimates from data collected through:

1) hundreds of sample surveys conducted each year covering virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture

2) the Census of Agriculture conducted every five years providing state- and county-level aggregates

The Quick Stats application programming interface (API) provides direct access to the statistical information in the Quick Stats database. We invite developers to use this API and to give us feedback so we can continue to improve it.

#### About the Quick Stats API

To use the Quick Stats API, you must first agree to the NASS Terms of Service and obtain an API key In registering for the key, you must provide a valid email address. You will have the option to request future email updates about the Quick Stats API.

Once you request the API key, we will email it and you can proceed immediately. Use the key in all future data requests as well.

To call the Quick Stats API, you may use either of the following:

any language that supports HTTP GET request such as PHP, PERL, etc...

JSON with padding or JSONP

Your request will return a maximum of 50,000 data records. You can determine the returned record account before you execute the Quick Stats API call using the GET /api/get_counts function. If your request will return more than the maximum limit of 50,000 data records, you can do either of the following:

Change the filtering criteria (the API input parameters and their values) to generate a smaller number of responses

Download the files containing larger amounts of data extracted from the Quick Stats database.

Using QuickStats API

QuickStats API requests utilize input parameters based on the concept of What, Where and When.

What parameters refer to a commodity, data item or subject area.

Where parameters refer to a location or geographic level such as the entire United States, state, county, district, or ZIP code.

When parameters refer to a time such as year and frequency such as monthly.

QuickStats API Input

The QuickStats API has three resources you can use to retrieve NASS published estimate data and properties, in combination with the "WHAT" and/or "WHERE" and/or "WHEN" parameters you specify. See Parameter Definitions and Operators for definitions and types. If you have not already
obtained an API key, do so now before proceeding.

Here are the resources, their URIs and examples:

- 1) GET /api/api_GET: accepts a combination of "WHAT" and/or "WHERE and/or "WHEN" parameters and return maximum of 50K records

https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api/api_GET/?key=api key&{parameter ... parameter}&format={json | csv | xml}&callback={function name}

Note: callback parameter needs only for using JSONP

Example of /api/api_GET request and its output.

QuickStats API Output

A request will return the published estimate for a given set of call parameters.

The api_GET resource supports three different output formats: JSON(default), XML or CSV.

The output format is identified by using the format parameter in the API request

Error messages

Error messages that the API will return:

- "exceeds limit = 50000" - The request would return more than 50,000 records/rows.

- "bad request - invalid query" - There is an error in the query string, such as wrong parameter name or value.

- "bad request - unsupport media type" - The request format parameter is not JSON or CSV or XML.

- "unauthorized" - There is no key or invalid key parameter.
