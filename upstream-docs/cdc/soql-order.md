- Queries using SODA

- The ORDER BY Clause

The ORDER BY clause determines how the results should be sorted, using the values from the specified columns, just like a SQL ORDER BY. Sorting can be performed in either ascending or descending order, the default being ascending, but you can also reverse the order with DESC.

For example, to sort our earthquakes by magnitude, in descending order:

The TryIt macro has been disabled until future notice while we upgrade this site to SODA3.

We could sort them in ascending order by replacing DESC with ASC, or by simply omitting it.

Heads Up! The order of the results of a query are not implicitly ordered, so if you're paging, make sure you provide an $order clause or at a minimum $order=:id. That will guarantee that the order of your results will be stable as you page through the dataset.
