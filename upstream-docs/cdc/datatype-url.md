The URL datatype is a type that contains a url and a description. It may be accessed as an object with 2 keys in it. These keys are:

- The url of the field. This can be directly accessed using dot notation: fieldName.url

- The description of the field (may be null). This can be directly accessed using dot notation: fieldName.description

The following operators can be used with URL fields:

Operator
Description

<
TRUE for strings that are alphanumerically before this string

<=
TRUE for strings that are alphanumerically before or equal to this string

>
TRUE for strings that are alphanumerically after this string

>=
TRUE for strings that are alphanumerically after or equal to this string

=
TRUE for strings that are equal to this string

!=
TRUE for strings that are not equal to this string

IS NULL
TRUE for strings that are NULL.

IS NOT NULL
TRUE for strings that are not NULL.

And the following functions can be used with them:

3.0
2.1
2.0

Keyword Name
Description
Availability

distinct
Returns distinct set of records
2.1 and 3.0

Function Name
Description
Availability

case(...)
Returns different values based on the evaluation of boolean comparisons
2.1 and 3.0

count(...)
Returns a count of a given set of records
2.0, 2.1, and 3.0

Here is what a URL field with both the url and the description looks like:

The TryIt macro has been disabled until future notice while we upgrade this site to SODA3.

If you just want the description string:

The TryIt macro has been disabled until future notice while we upgrade this site to SODA3.

Similarly, if you just want the url string:

The TryIt macro has been disabled until future notice while we upgrade this site to SODA3.
