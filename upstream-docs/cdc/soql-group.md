- The GROUP BY Clause

SoQL also provides a limited amount of aggregation functionality through its GROUP BY clause. GROUP BY must be used in conjunction with SELECT to provide the aggregation functions you wish to use. For example, to find the strongest earthquake by region, we want to $group by region and provide a $select of region, MAX(magnitude):

The TryIt macro has been disabled until future notice while we upgrade this site to SODA3.

The currently supported grouping expressions are:

Function
Datatypes Supported
Description

sum
Number
Sums up all the values in a grouping

count
All
Counts the number of values. null values are not counted

avg
Number
Finds the average value of numbers in this column

min
Number
Finds the minimum value of numbers in this column

max
Number
Finds the maximum value of numbers in this column
